        <h3>Rapid Application Development</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Rapid application development is a software development process introduced by James Martin in 1981. The term
            is now used to methodologies that use prototypes and iteration. Iteration is used to repeat the process in which
            the product is improved until the customer is satisfied.
        </p>
        <p>
            Upon each iteration, each prototype is evaluated by the customer and if it's necessary the prototype
            is improved upon until the customer is satisfied and the final prototype becomes the final product.
        </p>
        <p>
            An example of rapid application development is the spiral model. This model was documented in a paper by
            Barry W. Boehm in 1988 and the following describes the complicated model:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The Spiral model adds the RAD prototyping and risk analysis to the waterfall model
                and splits the entire cycle into four quadrants.
            </li>
            <li>Quadrant 1: determine objectives, alternatives and constraints</li>
            <li>Quadrant 2: evaluate alternatives, risks are identifies and resolved, if risks are too high the project
                may be stopped</li>
            <li>Quadrant 3: the prototype is developed</li>
            <li>Quadrant 4: planning takes place for the next phase</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            These are two quotes from Barry's book <span>"A spiral model of software development and enhancement"</span>
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <i>
                "Thus, the order of the steps was to do some coding first and to think about the requirements, design,
                test, and maintenance later. This model has three primary difficulties: (a) After a number of fixes, the
                code became so poorly structured that subsequent fixes were very expensive. This underscored the need for
                a design phase prior to coding. (b) Frequently, even well designed software was such a poor match to users'
                needs that it was either rejected outright or expensively redevelopment..."

        <blockquote>
            <i>
                "The spiral model presented in this article is one candidate for improving the software process model
                situation. The major distinguishing feature of the spiral model is that it creates a risk-driven approach
                to the software process rather than a primarily document-driven or code-driven process. It incorporates
                many of the strengths of other models and resolves many of their difficulties."
